# Dialogue

## User
Let's plan out the Q4 roadmap for our markdown viewer project.

## Assistant
Excellent! Let's break this down into phases:

## Phase 1: Core Features (Weeks 1-2)
- ✅ Firebase Authentication
- ✅ Markdown rendering
- ✅ User-isolated storage
- ✅ Conversation list view
- ✅ Individual conversation viewer

## Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Weeks 3-4)
- [ ] In-app markdown editor
- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] Tags and categories
- [ ] Export conversations

## Phase 3: Polish (Weeks 5-6)
- [ ] Dark mode
- [ ] Mobile optimization
- [ ] Performance improvements
- [ ] Analytics dashboard

## User
What about collaboration features?

## Assistant
Great idea! Here's a proposed Phase 4:

## Phase 4: Collaboration (Weeks 7-8)
- [ ] Share conversations with other users
- [ ] Real-time collaborative editing
- [ ] Comments and annotations
- [ ] Team workspaces

### Technical Considerations:
1. **Firebase Firestore** for real-time data
2. **Firebase Storage** for file uploads
3. **WebSocket** or **Firebase Realtime Database** for live updates
4. **Role-based access control** (Owner, Editor, Viewer)

## User
What's the priority for Phase 2?

## Assistant
Based on user value and technical complexity, I'd prioritize:

### High Priority
1. **In-app markdown editor** - Most requested feature
2. **Search functionality** - Essential for usability

### Medium Priority
3. **Tags and categories** - Nice organizational feature
4. **Export conversations** - Good for data portability

### Timeline
- Week 3: Editor foundation
- Week 3.5: Search implementation
- Week 4: Tags + Export

Does this align with your vision?

## User
Perfect! Let's also add keyboard shortcuts.

## Assistant
Excellent addition! Here are some useful shortcuts:

### Navigation
- `Cmd/Ctrl + K` - Quick search
- `Cmd/Ctrl + B` - Toggle sidebar
- `Cmd/Ctrl + N` - New conversation

### Editing (future editor)
- `Cmd/Ctrl + S` - Save
- `Cmd/Ctrl + B` - Bold
- `Cmd/Ctrl + I` - Italic
- `Cmd/Ctrl + K` - Insert link

I'll add this as a sub-task for Phase 2!

### Action Items:
1. Create detailed specs for editor
2. Research markdown editor libraries
3. Design keyboard shortcut system
4. User testing plan
